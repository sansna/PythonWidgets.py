# Most important info from https://pythonhosted.org/kitchen/unicode-frustrations.html:
#+ unicodes are python formatted, str type is I/O oriented. Thus, type unicode cannot
#+ be redirected to files, only str type can be redirected to I/O devices(file etc.).

# This can only be printed on screen, but not into file.
#a='\u7537' # a is of type string
#print a.decode('unicode-escape')

a='ç”·' # a is of type string
# This can be printed both on screen/file.
#print a
# decode the string to unicode with unicode()
s = unicode(a,'utf-8') # now s = u'\u7537', of type unicode
# This can be printed on screen, but not into file.
#print s
# This can be printed both on screen/file.
